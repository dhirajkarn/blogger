Learn Ethical Hacking the decent Way.', 'If you really want to get good at hacking (for a white hat purpose) then listen to security talks, learn several programming languages, set up a test lab at your house to practice on, etc. It takes an immense amount of time and learning to get there. If you show up on one of the forums in the article and beg to be taught how to hack, you will be laughed at. \r\nThere is no one way to hack. (If so, it would be a lot easier for system administrators to keep you out!) It’s a variety of different tricks as well as the ability to keep up with current vulnerabilities in software and hardware. You should also learn how to program. \r\nGo download wireshark, nmap, hping, and a C IDE and just play around with all of them. That’s what the essence of hacking is; messing around with technologies until you find something cool. Check out my Hacking Facebook post and you’ll see exactly what I mean; it’s not really “hacking” as such, all I did there was peek into facebook’s code using firebug, and I found some cool stuff. But the hacking skills are the same. Some of you will want to ask “how do I download wireshark” or “how do I use hping” – you must understand that answering the question for yourself is half the point.\r\n\r\nSource1:http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-5-websites-to-learn-how-to-hack-like-a-pro/\r\nSource2:http://www.puremango.co.uk/2004/12/', '2012-07-15 13:49:09', ''),

(25, 14, 'Happiness is Uncovering What You Already Have', '\r\nWhen I set out to convert my unhappiness with my life into happiness, about 7 years ago, I had some ideas about how to do it.\r\n \r\nI was going to get out of debt and lose weight and get a better job and declutter my house and get into shape and become productive and write a book.\r\n \r\nAnd I actually did all those things and much more. It was great. They changed my life, and I’m very happy now.\r\n \r\nThose things, however, didn’t get me happiness.\r\n \r\nWhat I learned is that I already had all I needed for happiness, but it was buried beneath my insecurities, my discontent with my life, my loathing of my body and myself. I already had it, but it was all covered up.\r\n \r\nHappiness is the uncovering of what you already have.\r\n \r\nYou have all you need for happiness, right now. You don’t need to change anything about yourself, or your life. You just need to see what’s already there.\r\n \r\nLet me show you what I found out about myself, and how I became happy.\r\n \r\nChanging My Life\r\n \r\nWhen I set out to become happy, I wanted to change my life. I had an ideal life that I wanted to create, and I thought if I created that life, I would be happy.\r\n \r\nIt’s all a fantasy. We all do it: we fantasize all the time about the ideal partner, the ideal kids, the ideal job, home, car, computer, clothes, travel, furniture, TV, and of course, body. If we have these ideal things, this perfect fantasy, we’ll be happy, right?\r\n \r\nWell, no. Because first, the fantasy can’t ever come true. We can believe we’re making it come true, but the reality will never match up with the fantasy.\r\n \r\nFor example, I learned this because while I decluttered and created a minimalist home, it didn’t automatically give me a feeling of contentedness. I needed to learn that separately.\r\n \r\nDecluttering, however, did teach me a lot: I learned about why I was holding on to things (fear), and learned that the fears were unfounded. I learned that I could do well even without all that false security, and that I was already strong enough to live life without a lot of unnecessary things.\r\n \r\nI still recommend simplifying your life, not because of the fantasy life you think you’ll create, but because you learn about yourself.\r\n \r\nWhen I lost weight, I was still unhappy with my body. It still wasn’t perfect. And let’s be honest: it will never be perfect, in the sense of matching the fantasy of the cover models you see on men’s magazines. I’ll never match up to that fantasy.\r\n \r\nBut losing weight taught me that I could enjoy eating healthier and exercising. I learned that these weren’t as scary as I thought, and that food is not needed as a crutch for stress, fears, loneliness, boredom and the like.\r\n \r\nThis was true in every area of my fantasy: I learned that striving for the fantasy didn’t ever work, that I could never get there, that even if I got close, I wouldn’t be happy. But I learned along the way that I didn’t need my old baggage, and that everything I needed for happiness was already in my possession.\r\n \r\nWhat You Need for Happiness\r\n \r\nSo what does make you happy? What do you need for happiness?\r\n \r\nYou can strive for happiness in external things all you like: house, job, car, a loving partner, food, drugs, shopping. But these don’t make you happy, at least not for long, and when they don’t give you continual happiness then you have to keep striving for more, and your happiness is always subject to the whim of these external things and people.\r\n \r\nYou can also find happiness within. You can learn that you have some amazing things inside you, that they are beautiful if you learn to accept them for what they are — and not try to meet up with any fantasy. You can learn that life is always amazing, as it is, without the fantasies. And because the happiness is within, you aren’t subject to losing it because people aren’t in the right mood, or because of external events changing your source of happiness.\r\n \r\nThis means stripping away the fantasies, one by one. It means looking within, and learning to be OK with what you find.\r\n \r\nIt’s not an overnight process, but the amazingness is already within you. It’s all around you (and actually within and without are not different things). No fantasies needed.\r\n \r\n\r\n', '2012-09-05 19:15:08', ''),
(26, 14, 'Mindful Simplicity: Decluttering, Cleaning & Leaving No Trace', '\r\nOur home isn’t as clean and sparse as a Zen temple, but when I see the clutter and dust of other people’s homes, it reminds me of how far we’ve come.\r\n \r\nThis is not a judgment on others, nor a proclamation of how great we are at cleaning and decluttering, but a reminder of what I’ve learned.\r\n \r\nCleaning and decluttering, for me, are mindfulness practices. They are not chores that I dread, nor ways to strive for a perfect living environment, but ways to practice living in the present moment. As such, they are some of my favorite things to do.\r\n \r\nI wipe a counter with a rag, but I’m not doing it thinking, “This kitchen is so dirty!” (judgment) or “I wish people would clean up after themselves!” (expecting things to be different) or “I have a lot of work to do today” (future thinking) or “My son really got on my nerves when he said that this morning” (dwelling on the past). Or at least, when I do think these things, I notice them, and return to the wiping.\r\n \r\nAs I wipe the counter, I notice the crumbs and dried spilled liquid. I feel the rag going over the bumpy surface of the counter, and gradually feel the surface smoothing out. I feel the tension in my shoulders and jaw, and relax them. I become aware of my breath as it comes in and goes out. I rinse the rag out carefully, cleaning it and watching the dirty water run down the drain.\r\n \r\nThis is practice for a mindful life. It is also life, already, not practice but the actual event. Wiping things down, mindfully, is just as full of wonder as any other moment in my life.\r\n \r\nI do the same as I wash dishes, declutter my closet or shelf, wipe down the sink or toilet, sweep. Each moment I spend doing these things is joyful wonder, and I am grateful for the moment I’m in.\r\n \r\nThe Principles\r\n \r\nIn the next section, I’m going to present a list of guidelines, but they’re just a bunch of specific things that help remind me of the general principles. The most important things are the general principles, which I try to remember:\r\n \r\n1. When you clean, just clean. Don’t plan, don’t have your mind on the next task as you’re doing the current task, don’t listen to a podcast or watch TV as you’re doing the task at hand. Just wipe. Just sweep. Just declutter. Just wash, just rinse.\r\n \r\n2. Do your work with gratitude and compassion. Before you start, remember to be grateful for what you have, for being able to clean or declutter. Be grateful for the people you have in your life, and remember why you’re grateful for them. Then remember you’re cleaning out of compassion: for the people in your life, so that their day might be a bit better for having a clean counter or sink, for yourself, so that you might have a nice uncluttered space in which to read a good book. This is your intention, and it will help you remember to be mindful.\r\n \r\n3. Pay attention to your thoughts, body, actions. Practice focusing your attention: on the rag, on the broom, on the dust. But also notice your thoughts: are you thinking about other things? Are you judging others? Are you wishing things were different? Are you angry? Don’t banish the thoughts, but notice them. Then return to the cleaning. Notice too as you clean your body, and your breathing. Notice everything about the moment, immerse yourself in the moment.\r\n \r\n4. Leave no trace. This, of course, is a philosophy of those who use the outdoors — to have a minimal impact on the land, to leave only footprints and take only pictures. But what about in our homes and workplaces? These aren’t quite as natural as a lake or mountain, perhaps, but they are our habitats. We must live here, often with loved ones, and so we should be mindful of the impact we’re having on this habitat. Leave no trace means that you don’t leave a mess, that you dispose of your waste properly, that you are respectful of other people in your space.\r\n \r\nThe Guidelines\r\n \r\nWith the above general principles, I’ve started creating a list of guidelines. These are not rules, but guideposts against which you can check yourself, to help you pay close attention to what you’re doing.\r\n \r\nI should note that I learned a lot of this from FlyLady, the gracious and mindful staff at Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, and from Dogen’s Instructions for the Tenzo.\r\n 1.Wash your bowl when you’re done with it. All other dishes too, of course.\r\n 2.Clean as you go. If you’re chopping vegetables, clean up the cutting board and knife when you’re done, and put food scraps in the compost. Don’t pile things on the counters or in the sink.\r\n 3.Have a place for everything. If something doesn’t have a place, designate one. Put things back in their place when you’re done.\r\n 4.Start decluttering where you are. Overwhelmed by all that you need to declutter? Start right where you are, and pick a few things that you don’t need or use, and put them in a bag or box to be donated or recycled. You’ve now started. Tomorrow, do it again.\r\n 5.Wipe your sink. Have the sink clean when you’re done with it. If it’s dirty, scrub it. There shouldn’t be dishes in the sink.\r\n 6.Wipe the counters and stove. When you’re done preparing food, wipe things down. It just takes a minute.\r\n 7.If a floor is dirty, take a minute to sweep it mindfully. It’s a nice break in your day.\r\n 8.Handle knives with care.\r\n 9.Swish the toilet bowl. Have a toilet brush near the toilet, and if you notice it even a little dirty after you use it, take the brush and give the bowl a quick swish and flush.\r\n 10.Keep rags and scrubbers handy. I keep a scrub sponge in my bathroom to wipe down the toilet or shower when they get a little dirty. It only takes a minute, and having the scrubber there means I have no reason not to do it.\r\n 11.Keep flat surfaces clear. My desk has nothing on it but my laptop and a photo of my wife. Counters and tabletops are clear. Floors have only furniture and rugs. These are not places for storing a bunch of junk. If you notice cluttered flat surfaces, clear them, one at a time. Get rid of the items, or give them a home.\r\n 12.Take care of your tools as if they were your own eyes.\r\n 13.Be gentle with those around you.\r\n 14.You are already there. This is not a set of ideals to aspire to, a standard of perfection to achieve. This is a mindfulness practice, and if you are cleaning or decluttering mindfully, you have already arrived.\r\n \r\n', '2012-09-05 19:16:34', ''),
(29, 14, 'The Habit of Starting', 'The biggest reason people fail at creating and sticking to new habits is that they don’t keep doing it.\r\n \r\nThat seems obvious: if you don’t keep doing a habit, it won’t really become a habit. So what’s the solution to this obvious problem? Find a way to keep doing it.\r\n \r\nWhen you look at it this way, the key to forming a habit is not how much you do of the habit each day (exercise for 30 minutes, write 1,000 words, etc.), but whether you do it at all. So the key is just getting started.\r\n \r\nLet me emphasize that: the key to forming a habit is starting each day.\r\n \r\nWhat do I mean by starting? If you want to form the habit of meditation, just get your butt on the cushion each day. If you want to form the habit of running, just lace up your shoes and get out the door. If you want to form the habit of writing, just sit down, close everything else on your computer, and start typing.\r\n \r\nForm the habit of starting, and you’ll get good at forming habits.\r\n \r\nHow to Start When You Face Resistance\r\n \r\nForm the habit of starting — easier said than done, right? What happens when you wake up and don’t feel like doing yoga or your beach body exercise DVD?\r\n \r\nLet’s first take a look at why you don’t feel like starting. It’s usually for one or both of these reasons:\r\n 1.You are comfortable with what you’re doing (reading online, probably), and the habit is less comfortable (it’s too hard). We cling to the comfortable.\r\n 2.It’s too difficult to get started — to do the habit, you have to get a bunch of equipment out of your garage, or drive 20 minutes to the gym, or go get a bunch of ingredients, etc.\r\n \r\nThose are the main two reasons, and really they’re the same thing.\r\n \r\nSo the solution is to make it easier and more comfortable to do the habit, and easier to get started. Some ways to do that:\r\n •Focus on the smallest thing — just getting started. You don’t have to do even 5 minutes — just start. That’s so easy it’s hard to say no.\r\n •Prepare everything you need to get started earlier. So if you need some equipment, get it ready well before you have to start, like the evening before, or in the morning if you have to do it in the afternoon, or at least an hour before. Then when it’s time to start, there is no barrier.\r\n •Make the habit something you can do where you are, instead of having to drive there.\r\n •If you have to drive or walk somewhere, have someone meet you there. Then you’re less likely to stay home (or at work), and more likely to go — and going there is the same thing as getting started. This works because you’re making it less comfortable to not start — the idea of leaving a friend waiting for you at the gym or park is not a comfortable one.\r\n •Tell people you’re going to do the habit of starting your habit every day for 30 days. Having this kind of accountability motivates you to get started, and makes it less comfortable not to start.\r\n •Start with the easiest version of the habit, so that it’s easy to start. For example, if you want to form the habit of reading, don’t start with Joyce, but with Grisham or Stephen King or whoever you find fun and easy to read. If you want to start yoga, don’t start with a really challenging routine, but an easy series of sun salutations.\r\n \r\nMake it as easy as possible to start, and hard to not start. Tell yourself that all you have to do is lace up your shoes and get out the door, and you’ll have a hard time saying no. Once you’ve started, you’ll feel good and probably want to continue (though that’s not a necessity).\r\n \r\nThe start is a sunrise: a moment of brilliance that signals something joyful has arrived. Learn to love that moment of brilliance, and your habit troubles fade like the night.\r\n', '2012-09-20 19:21:59', ''),
(30, 14, 'Finding Peace with Uncertainty', 'Fear of an uncertain future: it can stop us from doing great things, and it can keep us holding onto things that are hurting us.\r\n\r\nFor example: you might be holding onto clutter for reasons of comfort and security, even if the clutter gives you anxiety and costs a lot of money.\r\n\r\nAnd: you might be staying in a job you don’t like, because you’re afraid of taking the plunge, because you’re afraid of failing.\r\n\r\nAnd again: you might not travel to a country that feels very unfamiliar because you don’t know what will happen — and miss out on an amazing life-changing experience.\r\n\r\nThis is just the start of how fear of an uncertain future affects our lives.\r\n\r\nA reader recently asked “how to be at peace with uncertainty, how to let go of fear of the future.” It’s a great question, because we all deal with this fear. All of us.\r\n\r\nWhat’s Going On Here\r\n\r\nWhere does this fear of uncertainty and the future come from? It might seem like a silly question, but if you think about it, there’s nothing inherently scary about the future, even if you don’t know what’s going to happen. It’s not more likely to be painful or disastrous than the present already is — it just seems that way.\r\n\r\nThink about it: the odds of you getting into a car accident is not greater tomorrow than it is today. The odds of anything bad happening are not greater next week than they were this week. The odds of something great happening are also just as great next month as they were this month.\r\n\r\nSo why is it scary? Why is not knowing so scary? If you roll a dice and don’t know what it will be, is that scary? No, it’s not the “not knowing” that’s the problem … it’s the possibility that what comes up on that dice will bring us pain, suffering, loss.\r\n\r\nAnd this imagined pain isn’t physical pain (most of the time we’re not fearing physical injury) … it’s the pain of loss and change. We are comfortable in this cocoon we’ve built up around ourselves — these routines and possessions and people we know and places that are familiar and safe. Losing this comforting environment, and going into a place where we’re vulnerable and might fail, might not be good enough, is painful and scary.\r\n\r\nWe grasp, clinging to this comfortable idea of how things should be, and of course it will change, and we will feel the pain of that change.\r\n\r\nThe change itself isn’t the problem — it’s fighting the change, fearing the change, not wanting things to be different.\r\n\r\nHow to Get Good at Uncertainty\r\n\r\nAnd so we see that the answer is becoming good at change. If we are good at dealing with new things, with things as they come no matter how different they are, then we don’t fear it. Then change itself becomes comfortable.\r\n\r\nIf we become comfortable with change, it’s not scary. We can then embrace it, find joy in it. You can see this in people who we call “adventurous” — they seek new experiences, because they know they’ll be fine, and that it can be amazing. (Note that this is different than the “adventure-seeker” types who have turned excitement into their form of comfort — when the excitement is taken away, then they feel the pain and loss of this change.)\r\n\r\nSo how do we get good at change? Some suggestions that are working for me (I’m still learning):\r\n •Try something new, but small and safe. New things can be scary because we’re afraid we’re going to fall on our faces. But if it’s something small — learning to juggle beanbags in our living room, learning to balance on a rope that’s close to the ground, listening to a language-learning podcast, for example — it’s not as scary. There’s no real risk of getting hurt. And the more we do this, in small, non-scary steps, the more confidence we’ll gain that new things are not painful.\r\n •When you mess up, don’t see it as painful failure. When you’re doing new things, there will be times when you make mistakes, mess up, “fail”. But these words are associated with negative things, like pain … instead, start to look at mistakes and “messing up” as something positive — it’s the only way to learn. Messing up is a way to get better at something, to grow, to get stronger.\r\n •See the wonder and opportunity in change. Change might mean leaving a comfort zone, and losing something (or someone) you love, but there’s much more: it’s the bringing of something new and amazing, a new opportunity to explore and learn and meet new people and reinvent yourself. When change happens, look for the wonder in it, the new doors that have opened.\r\n •Ask “what’s the worst-case scenario”? If you’re exposing yourself, getting out of your comfortable environment, leaving behind security … it can be scary, but when you think about what is the worst thing that is likely to happen, usually it’s not that bad. If you lost all your possessions today in a disaster, how bad would that be? How would you cope? What opportunities would there be? What new things could you invent from this blank slate?\r\n •Develop a change toolset. Learn how to cope with changes, no matter what they are. Have a fall-back plan if things collapse. Have friends and family you can call on. Develop some skills where you can get a job or start a new business no matter what happens with your current job or the economy. Learn ways of making friends with strangers, finding your way around a strange city, surviving on little. With a toolset like this, you can feel confident that you can handle just about anything that comes.\r\n •Become aware of your clinging. Watch yourself clinging to something when you feel fear and pain. What are you clinging to? Often it’s just an idea — the idea of you and a romantic partner, an image of who you are. Become aware of what’s going on.\r\n •See the downsides of clinging. Once you see your clinging more clearly, see the pain that results from it. If you’re clinging to your stuff, see the space it takes up, and the extra rent that costs you … see the mental energy it takes to live with all the stuff, the money you’ve spent on it, the lack of space you have to live. Anything you cling to has a downside — we only see the good side of it, and so we want to cling to it.\r\n •Experience the joy in the unknown. When something new happens, when you don’t know — we often see this as bad. But can we re-frame it so that it’s something joyful? Not knowing means we are free — the possibilities are limitless. We can invent a new path, a new identity, a new existence. This can be joyful.\r\n', '2012-09-29 09:10:42', ''),

If so, why are you looking towards the future, when you’re already there?\n\nAnd if we don’t think where we are is already great, perhaps we’re not paying close enough attention.\n\nWaiting in Lines & Traffic\n\nRecently I had to drive a moving truck for six hours, and caught myself thinking, “I can’t wait until I’m there!” Of course, when I noticed that thought, I reminded myself: “You’re already there.”\n\nWhere I was — alone, in a truck, on a highway, in the middle of beautiful country — was already great. Perhaps my legs were tired, but that was an opportunity to feel my legs, when so many of us forget they’re there as we sit all day. It was a chance to remember that I’m alive, which we take for granted. We daily participate in the miracle of life, and to us it’s not only routine and dull, we often think it sucks.\n\nMy legs were tired, so I pulled over at a rest stop, stretched my legs, laid in the grass, stared up at the sky. My tired legs gave me this possibility, and so tired legs don’t suck, they are great.\n\nThe next time you find yourself waiting in traffic or in a line, and you’re thinking, “Can’t wait until I get there!” … remember that you are already in a place that’s great. Perhaps that’s in a car, alone, but what’s wrong with being alone? Can’t you listen to music, sing a tune you love, dance? Can’t you look outside at the sky and realize what greatness surrounds you? Can’t you talk to yourself and find out what great company you are?\n\nIf you’re in a line, aren’t you surrounded by fascinating human beings? What a great time to watch and listen and learn.\n\nThe Tragedy of Goals\n\nWe set goals, these little dreams of what the future will be like, and focus on them. Every day, we work on these goals, take a step closer to getting to that great future. When the goal is completed, yay! Now what? Next goal. And then the next. This kind of forward-looking thinking doesn’t end when you get to the goal, and never ends until you no longer have any life left, no future to look to.\n\nBut actually, it can end — right now. Stop looking to that goal, and look at where you are.\n\nThe goal might sound great: run a marathon, complete a project, get out of debt, get nice abs, make a million dollars. But it’s a fantasy, and when (if) that fantasy comes true, it won’t be what you imagined. It will feel like regular life, not some amazing new life that is different than the life you had. Life won’t be better, and never will be, until you stop wishing for this better life and realize that life is already incredible.\n\nThis life, right now, is already perfect! Enjoy it, and forget about those goals. Getting to them won’t be any better than the amazing life that’s right here, at this moment.\n\nI get asked, “What do I do if I don’t have anything I want?” Well, stop wishing for those things. They aren’t better than what you already have, which is a ridiculously unlikely event called life.\n\nWaiting for My Baby\n\nSo many people are waiting for their dream lover, that perfect person who is going to love them, make their life perfect.\n\nThat person may or may not show up, but the tragedy is not that you don’t have Mr. or Mrs. Dreamy … it’s that you’re waiting for happiness.\n\nYou don’t need another person to love you, to complete you, to make you happy. That person is already there, with you right now. (Spoiler alert: it’s you.)\n\nYou are the best company, the person who will always be around, the unconditional love you’re looking for. You just need to stop waiting for Dreamy McDreamerson, and look at yourself. Really notice yourself. Accept yourself. Love yourself, as you are, without wishing you were different.\n\nThis might take few tries, but try it right now. You might find that you’re the dreamy love of your life you’ve been waiting for.\n\nThree Things to Do Today\n\nHow do you stop waiting for good things to come? Three things you can do right now, today:\n 1.Slow down. Rushing means you miss what’s right here.\n 2.Pay attention. Look at what’s around you right now. Look at yourself, and how great you are. If it doesn’t seem great, look closer.\n 3.Applaud.\n \n\n‘We never live; we are always in the expectation of living.’ ~Voltaire\n ', '2012-10-05 08:53:54', ''),
(33, 14, 'The Willingness to Think Differently', 'I can summarize the most successful people I’ve ever known with one trait: the willingness to challenge mainstream ideas.\r\n\r\nThis has been the key to everything good in my life too:\r\n •I changed my health and drastically reduced my carbon footprint when I stopped eating like everyone else around me and became vegetarian (and eventually vegan).\r\n •I simplified my life when I stopped believing what the majority of people believe, that buying stuff makes you happier, more secure, look better in the eyes of others, etc.\r\n •Eva & I improved our kids’ learning environment when we went against the mainstream and started unschooling.\r\n •We improved our health and reduced our carbon footprint when we went car-free.\r\n •I changed my career by blogging differently than others (on simplifying rather than doing more) when I started Zen Habits.\r\n \r\nAnd there are many more examples, but you get the point.\r\n\r\nThis isn’t a post to brag about all of that — it’s to share what I believe is a real key to life: the willingness to think differently than most people.\r\n\r\nIt means you have to be willing to question what most people do and tell you. It means you have to have the courage to try something different. It means you have to be brave enough to stand out from the crowd and not take the safe route.\r\n\r\nThe Safe Route\r\n\r\nMost people take the safe route, because they’re afraid of being different and failing. If you do nothing amazing but you go with the crowd, then you don’t look stupid. But then you miss out on the amazing.\r\n\r\nIf you never stand out from the crowd, you will always be average. And that’s fine, but the people who stand out are the ones who make a mark, who innovate and discover, who learn the freedom of exploration and invention.\r\n\r\nIf you stand out when you apply for a job, you’ll be more likely to be noticed. If you don’t, and you play it safe, then they’ll likely ignore you.\r\n\r\nIf you stand out when you start a business, people will be curious and check you out. If you’re just one of many businesses doing the same thing, why should others care about you? Why should they choose you?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, most people play it safe:\r\n •Most people go to school and then college because that’s what everyone else does. They don’t know what they really want to do, so why not take the traditional route? And that’s fine, but it’s good to look into other options.\r\n •Most people get a job and stick to it because that’s the traditional way to make a living. Others might be a solo entrepreneur or start a small business and dare to create something new and live a life they’re passionate about.\r\n •Most people eat meat and dairy and eggs because that’s how they were brought up, and eating differently is weird and unthinkable. “I love my ribs too much!” But then you miss out on a whole world of healthy, delicious food, and the opportunity to change the planet and help reduce one of the most cruel things our society has ever done.\r\n •Most people drive a car, because that’s what everyone else does — and changing it is too difficult. And yet, cars pollute and cost a lot and make us less healthy and make the streets less safe for our communities and take up most of our public spaces.\r\n \r\nThese are just some examples — our need to play it safe turns up in every part of our lives.\r\n\r\nLearning to Think Differently\r\n\r\nWhen you hear an idea that’s different than what you’re used to, pause. Instead of rejecting it outright, consider it — is there some merit? What are the arguments, the evidence?\r\n\r\nLet go of the emotions that come up, the defensiveness. When I mention the cruelty in meat and eggs and dairy and leather and wool (even the “humanely” raised animal products), for example, people become defensive and angry. They cover their eyes and ears, so they can go on doing what feels comfortable. They lash out and attack. And yet, if you set aside those emotions, and look at the arguments, you might learn to think differently — and that applies to all ideas, not just veganism.\r\n\r\nWhen you are told that this is the way to do things, take a second look. Is this really the best way? Are there other possibilities? If no one has thought of them, can you?\r\n\r\nJust because an idea is different, don’t just accept it. Look at the bulk of the evidence, and learn to spot flaws in reasoning. For example, there is a school of people who believe that soy is bad for you, saturated fat (animal fat) is good for you, we should all drink raw milk, slather butter on everything (the Weston A. Price Foundation). This is different than mainstream science, but it’s wrong. The bulk of the evidence is against what they believe, and their reasoning is wrong.\r\n\r\nTest out different ideas. Just because most people don’t do it, doesn’t mean it’s wrong. They might all be wrong, and this might be better. No better way to find out than to test it. If it’s not a good idea, drop it and move on.\r\n\r\nLearn to be proud of your ability to test things that people traditionally believe in, and not to worry so much if you stand out. In fact, learn to see standing out as good — not just to stand out, but to forge new ground, to challenge ideas, to express your individual voice rather than blending in.\r\n', '2012-11-04 10:03:47', ''),
